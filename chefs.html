                    <p>Nigella has been teaching us about the pleasures of the table since her first book, How to Eat, hit the shelves in 1998.
                    She has since published several best-selling cookery books, many complementing an accompanying television series, and
                    has become known for her sensual descriptions of her dishes.</p>
                    
                   <p> Nigella studied Medieval and Modern Languages at Oxford, and went on to work as a publisher, becoming deputy literary
                    editor of The Sunday Times. She then pursued a successful career as a freelance journalist, during which time her work
                    was published in significant culinary and lifestyle magazines around the world.</p>
                    
                    <p>Nigella was voted author of the year at the 2001 British Book Awards. In 2001 she was awarded – but turned down – an OBE
                    from Her Majesty the Queen for services to journalism and cookery.</p>
